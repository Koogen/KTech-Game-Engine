# KTech Game Engine
Thank you for downloading the KTech Game Engine!

KTech is an open source 2D Game engine written from scratch in java, and can be run on any OS with JRE 1.7 or newer installed.

It runs on basically any system, the lowest specs tested being a rasperry pi zero. 
However, this also depends on how well the game itself is optimized as well.

Please give credit if you make a game with this engine

KTech was made by the veteran programmer of the Terracraft team, Koogen. It is used for most of our in house games that we make.

===TUTORIAL===

For images, to add transparency you have to fill the transparent area with the hex color value of 0xff00ff

In order to make a game with the KTech game engine, you must extract and drop the files into your eclipse workspace.
Then, go into eclipse and make a new Java Project called "KTech Game Engine" (Case Sensitive) and click finish.

It will open with an example project that you can then modify in the example package, and the KTech packages
are what contain the engine itself.

If you have a general knowlege of Java, you should be able to read the comments in the example project
and fairly easily understand how it works.
